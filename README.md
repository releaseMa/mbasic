updeatd!
  -Vars are now in float(double)

  -faster to read/write a var ,based on ACSII table's linear alphabet between the alphabet and the numbet 0~25
  
  -a lighter line number analzying logic is now avalible,for a Python-liked script format.
  
  -an extendable function searching logic is coming soon.
  
It's a milestone for me that the Analziation Part is,done,and the next part would be Execution,I guess a arduino daemon will be published on Mid-Febaurary.
Again,Thanks for Jian's patience.
